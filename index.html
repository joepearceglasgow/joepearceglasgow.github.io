	<h1>Hi there, I'm Joe Pearce!</h1>
	<p>I'm PhD researcher at the University of Glasgow interested in gender, voice quality and sociophonetics! </p>
	<p>My research looks at the production and perception of voice quality in contemporary Scotland from a trans-focused perspective. For my Masters’ thesis, I investigated whether listeners use creaky voice and breathy voice as cues to a speaker’s gender. </p>
	<p>My PhD research builds on this, combining a corpus study looking at voice quality across three regions of Scotland with an in-depth look at three transgender speakers’ use of voice quality and how they understand it.</p>
