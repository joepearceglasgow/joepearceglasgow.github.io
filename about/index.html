title: About me
---

I graduated from my undergraduate degree in English Language & Linguistics in 2018, where I focused on sociolinguistics and phonetics and ended up writing my dissertation on sociophonetic variation in trans speakers. During this time I also took sociology for two years, sparking my interest in qualitative research methods and trans studies.

I went on to do a research masters, looking at how pitch and voice quality contribute to how we perceive gender, and then began my PhD.

My PhD looks at gender and voice quality in contemporary Scotland, and consists of two main parts:

<ul>
  <li> A corpus study using data collected as part of the <a href="https://scotssyntaxatlas.ac.uk/"> Scots Syntax Atlas </a>, considering first how auditory descriptions of voice quality map onto acoustic measurements, and second how voice quality varies according to age, gender and region across Glasgow, Lothian and Shetland in an acoustic study. </li>
  <li> An in-depth look at three transgender speakersâ€™ use of voice quality, considering how they understand their experiences with changes in their voice over time and between different situations using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, and looking at how their use of voice quality varies between conversations with different people from their lives in an acoustic study. </li>
</ul>

Outside of phonetics, I enjoy climbing, running, and growing my own mushrooms!
