<h1>Resources, publication and conference presentations</h1>

<h2>Conference presentation</h2>
You can find slides from conferences I've presented at here. I generally try to use minimal text on slides, which means that the slides alone might not always give a full picture of the talk - Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about any of the talks below.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://joepearceglasgow.github.io/resources/JoePearce_UKLVC13_PhonationProfileAnalysis.pdf">Joe Pearce. 2021.
