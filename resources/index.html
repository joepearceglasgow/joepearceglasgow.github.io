<h1>Resources, publications and conference presentations</h1>

<h2>Conference presentation</h2>
You can find slides from conferences I've presented at here. I generally try to use minimal text on slides, which means that the slides alone might not always give a full picture of the talk - Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about any of the talks below.
